        <p>Alita: Battle Angel is a movie that sticks with the source material and keeps with it. The movie seems to have the same look as the manga with realism mixed in and feels like a mix of wild west lawlessness and a cyberpunk dystopian sci-fi.
        <br>The visual effcts were some of the best that there could have been possibly even now. The motion capture to animate Alita's face and all of the different cyborgs and everything feels real and lifelike. Many people disliked the anime/manga eyes of alita but i feel that it is right because she is supposed to be different from everyone else, even other cyborgs, and the eyes make the difference more reinforced
